# discord-bot-lib

This is a library for writing bots for discord in Go.
It is still in a bit of a rough and fluid state (lacking lots of docs
in particular).

See the following for example projects built on it:

- [discord-signup-bot](https://www.github.com/gsmcwhirter/discord-signup-bot)
- [discord-have-want-bot](https://www.github.com/gsmcwhirrter/discord-have-want-bot)

## TODO

- documentation
- tests
- more payload handling?
